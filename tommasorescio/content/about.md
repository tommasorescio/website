My name is **Tommaso Rescio**. I was born and raised in **Florence** (Italy) not so many years ago.

I’m currently a **research fellow** at the [Politecnico di Torino](polito.it). In March 2021 I won a scholarship organized by [Consortium GARR](garr.it), which is in charge of designing and managing a high-performance network infrastructure that delivers advanced services to all Italian universities. I received the scholarship as my master thesis can be considered innovative. Indeed, I have carried out my thesis project on the **Analysis of Anomalous Traffic Via DPI Enhanced Honeypots**. This study addresses the field of cybersecurity, in particular the development of automatic methods of network monitoring and identification of anomalies that are able to highlight cyber-attacks. I also had the opportunity to research on network topics and I published [two papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VTVB988AAAAJ). This for me is very interesting and stimulating for it gives me the feeling of contributing to a bigger purpose.

In April 2021 I obtained my Master Degree in **Communications and Computer Network Engineering** at Politecnico di Torino while in April 2018 I obtained my Bachelor Degree in **Computer Science Engineering** at [Università degli Studi di Firenze](unifi.it).

My passion for technology has led me to travel the world. This is because I strongly believe that the best way to learn and grow both humanly and professionally is to experience first-hand real-life situations where those technological skills need to be applied. Over the years, I have had the chance to visit the Google European head office in Dublin, the Apple offices in New York and the Microsoft Headquarters in Lisbon. Furthermore, I have also participated in the 2015, 2017 and 2021 Lisbon [**Web Summit**](websummit.com) as a volunteer.
